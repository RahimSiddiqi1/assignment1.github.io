        "description": "Modern web applications are built on a tangle of technologies that have been developed over time and then haphazardly pieced together. Every piece of the web application stack, from HTTP requests to browser-side scripts, comes with important yet subtle security consequences. To keep users safe, it is essential for developers to confidently navigate this landscape. In The Tangled Web, Michal Zalewski, one of the world’s top browser security experts, offers a compelling narrative that explains exactly how browsers work and why they’re fundamentally insecure. Rather than dispense simplistic advice on vulnerabilities, Zalewski examines the entire browser security model, revealing weak points and providing crucial information for shoring up web application security. You’ll learn how to: –Perform common but surprisingly complex tasks such as URL parsing and HTML sanitization –Use modern security features like Strict Transport Security, Content Security Policy, and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing –Leverage many variants of the same-origin policy to safely compartmentalize complex web applications and protect user credentials in case of XSS bugs –Build mashups and embed gadgets without getting stung by the tricky frame navigation policy –Embed or host user-supplied content without running into the trap of content sniffing For quick reference, \"Security Engineering Cheat Sheets\" at the end of each chapter offer ready solutions to problems you’re most likely to encounter. With coverage extending as far as planned HTML5 features, The Tangled Web will help you create secure web applications that stand the test of time.",

The JavaScript tooling landscape has grown and matured drastically in the past several years. This book will serve as an introduction to both new and well established libraries, frameworks, and utilities that have gained popular traction and support from seasoned developers. It covers tools applicable to the entire development stack, both client- and server-side. While no single book can possibly cover every JavaScript library of value, JavaScript Frameworks for Modern Web Dev focuses on incredibly u seful libraries and frameworks that production software uses. You will be treated to detailed analyses and sample code for tools that manage dependencies, structure code in a modular fashion, automate repetitive build tasks, create specialized servers, structure client side applications, facilitate horizontal scaling, and interacting with disparate data stores. The libraries and frameworks covered include Bower, Grunt, Yeoman, PM2, RequireJS, Browserify, Knockout, AngularJS, Kraken, Mach, Mongoose, Knex, Bookshelf, Faye, Q, Async.js, Underscore, and Lodash. Written from first-hand experience, you will benefit from the glorious victories and innumerable failures of two experienced professionals, gain quick insight into hurdles that aren't always explicitly mentioned in API documentation or Readmes, and quickly learn how to use JavaScript frameworks and libraries like a Pro. Enrich your development skills with JavaScript Frameworks for Modern Web Dev today.",

DESCRIPTION Deno is a web platform that offers capabilities for JavaScript and TypeScript and supports modern web standards. It is a straightforward, up-to-date, secure runtime environment for web developers. This book will teach all you need to know about Deno's primitives, its ideas, and how you can use them to build applications that work in the real world. The book's first part is devoted to familiarizing you with Deno's runtime and comprehensive ecosystem. This book will help you to get familiar with TypeScript and experiment with Deno. The book will also help you to learn about GraphQL and Oak and build basic scripts. It will help you to design basic web applications such as a phonebook application and a to-do list application, both of which will have their user interfaces (UI) and APIs developed. This book will help you to get a good level of confidence with Deno over NodeJS so that you can start using Deno to build, maintain, and deploy web apps that are reliable and secure. WHAT YOU WILL LEARN ● Get started with the basics of TypeScript and Deno. ● Use Deno to create your next React or Svelte app's user interface. ● Develop a GraphQL API server with Deno. ● Make the most of TypeScript when creating applications. ● Take advantage of the various plugins that Deno and its creators offer. WHO THIS BOOK IS FOR Readers interested in utilizing the power of Deno to fuel their apps, whether they are web developers, TypeScript users, or JavaScript users will find this book helpful. The code will be easier to understand if you are familiar with JavaScript already. TABLE OF CONTENTS 1. The Deno Land 2. Introduction to TypeScript 3. Setting Up Deno 4. Deno Ecosystem 5.
